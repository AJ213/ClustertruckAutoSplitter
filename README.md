## Notes
 - Debugging requires Assembly-CSharp files from your install
 - Debugging also requires you to replace the static file paths
 - Development may not be as active as it should
 - Where possible, releases will be made. Don't think that they are actual releases. Think of them as incredibly buggy snapshots.
